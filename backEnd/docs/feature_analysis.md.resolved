## Recommendations for Next Steps

### Priority 1: Manual Override Feature
- Add evaluation edit UI for teachers in [StudentAssignmentTracker.jsx](file:///c:/Users/bhuva/IAFP/frontEnd/IAFP/src/components/StudentAssignmentTracker.jsx)
- Create backend endpoint to update evaluation marks and feedback
- Add teacher approval flag to evaluation records

### Priority 2: Publish Results Workflow
- Add `isPublished` flag to evaluation model
- Create UI toggle for teachers to publish/unpublish results
- Filter student-facing feedback to only show published evaluations
- Add backend API to toggle publish status

### Priority 3: UI Enhancements
- Add visual indicators for published vs unpublished results
- Show draft status in teacher evaluation view
- Add bulk publish functionality for multiple evaluations
